# LeaveCalendar
A visual representation of leave requests throughout the year, with each month displayed as a separate calendar.

## The color red is used when multiple people have applied for leave on the same day.
## Each user is assigned a unique color for their leave entries.
## If the colors are not clear, you can refresh the page to get different colors.
## When you select a specific department, the page will reload and display a table in the bottom left corner showing the leave balances for that department.
## Clicking on a specific day's link will reload the page and show a table in the bottom right corner listing the users who have taken leave on that day.
